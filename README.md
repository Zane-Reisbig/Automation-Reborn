<h3>The purpose of this library is to make it easy to create automation and macros</h3>
<p>There are many like it but this one is mine</p>

I wanted to make this purely in python because I like the language and I wanted to build something of scale in it. <br>
There are uses for all the things inside this library and I feel like it is easy to use. <br>
There is an example file and all the code is documented with intelisense support. <br>
If you have any questions or comments let me know, and start a github issue if you find anything breaking. <br>
If you feel like fixing it yourself feel free to branch and create a pull request, ðŸ˜„
